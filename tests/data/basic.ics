DESCRIPTION:http://hubhacks.challengepost.com\n\n---\n\nMayor Martin J. Wal
 sh made a commitment early in his first tenure to make processes like Permi
 tting easier on Bostonians\, from individuals hoping to start small busines
 ses\, to developers and contractors\, to  homeowners looking to make additi
 ons on their homes. In addition to a full review of the permitting applicat
 ion process and portal\, Mayor Walsh\, along with the Department of Innovat
 ion and Technology (DoIT) and the Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics (MO
 NUM)\, is inviting IT developers and members of the Boston community to com
 e together for HubHacks\, the City’s first-ever civic minded Hackathon.\n\n
 At this in-person Hackathon\, developers are invited to work together to at
 tempt to solve a series of challenges that represent the most pressing pain
  points for those seeking permit applications. Teams can pick among four av
 ailable challenges related to the permitting system of the City of Boston. 
 On the second day\, teams will present their solutions and those with the b
 est ideas for each challenge will be recognized. The challenges include:\n\
 n    Which Permits Do I Need?: A single project may require multiple permit
 s. Applicants need a clear\, intuitive\, and enjoyable guide that will help
  applicants identify the permits they need to start working!\n\n    What’s 
 my Address of Record?: Every project needs to be linked to an address in th
 e City’s master database.  In the current system\, finding your address is 
 tougher than it should be. Our new online system needs a clear way to searc
 h addresses and suggest alternatives\, getting it right the first time.\n\n
     Can I Apply for that Permit Online?: With September 1st weeks away\, de
 velopers will try their hand at a challenge to provide a very practical sol
 ution using the City’s new API - creating a simple online and/or mobile app
 lication for Street Occupancy permits required to block space for a moving 
 truck.  \n\n    Where am I in the Approval Process?: Complex building proje
 cts can take months to review and permit\, even if the process works correc
 tly. Residents needs a clear way to track all permits associated with their
  project\, which helps them understand how close they are to getting underw
 ay. \n

 ets-11331786679\n\nBoston is home to one of the oldest public transportatio
 n systems in the United States. Because of this\, the historic streets and 
 systems are consistently undergoing upgrades and rebuilds\, causing unwante
 d traffic and delays.\n\nBut with the rise of new technologies\, solutions 
 are being developed.\n\nDistrict Hall recently hosted the 37 Billion Mile D
 ata Challenge highlighting the vast array of data available related to driv
 ing in Massachusetts. More data is available from the Open MBTA initiative 
 providing improved information to citizens and better analysis to the MBTA.
 \n\nAs Bostonians demand more from our public transit systems\, let’s put o
 ur expertise in technology and innovation to work to create new ways to add
 ress the transportation challenges in our city.\n\nPlease join us at Distri
 ct Hall\, in Boston’s thriving Innovation District\, for a discussion on te
 chnology and transportation. We want to expand the conversation to address 
 the harder and broader problems that public groups are facing. A distinguis
 hed panel will discuss how technology relates to local transportation in to
 day's world and how the solutions can help the city of Boston. Panelists in
 clude:\n\nSecretary Richard Davey\, Massachusetts Department of Transportat
 ion\n\nJosh Robin\, Vice President for Strategy and Development\, Masabi\n\

 ---\n\nThe International Space Apps Challenge is an international mass coll
 aboration focused on space exploration that takes place over 48-hours in ci
 ties around the world. The event embraces collaborative problem solving wit
 h a goal of producing relevant open-source solutions to address global need
 s applicable to both life on Earth and life in space. This year we have 40 
 challenges and 25 projects from last year's Space Apps that support NASA's 
 mission directorates in five themes: Earth Watch\, Technology in Space\, Hu
 man Spaceflight\, Robotics and Asteroids. NASA is leading this global colla
 boration along with a number of government collaborators and 100+ local org
 anizations.

 rd of the land is open to the public. We invite you to reimagine that space
 . How can our streets\, plazas\, sidewalks\, street furniture\, and public 
 buildings better serve people?\n\nThe Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics
  Streetscape Lab is sourcing ideas from designers\, makers\, artists\, and 
 engineers to improve Boston. We are asking members of our vibrant creative 
 community to submit project ideas to make our public spaces simple\, intuit

  a new way of using an existing product. The City will review the submissio
 ns and may select up to six ideas total to implement in the following categ
 ories:\n\nThe Streetscape: sidewalks\, streets\, medians\, plazas\, and our
  other civic front porches. What improvements would you make to space? What
  is the next iteration of our classic street furniture? Look at the sample 
 locations to get you thinking.\n\nBoston City Hall: rethinking the indoor a
 nd outdoor space\, signage\, improving service delivery and the user experi
 ence. These designs may help inform future improvements to the building.\n\
 nRandom Awesome Designs: great ideas that defy classification or location.

 ommunity.\n\nThe talk track is geared towards civic activists\, researchers
 \, academics\, government folks\, and other non-coders who want to learn mo

 on: Geoff Mamlet\, Shaina Semiatin and Katie Shultz\nalong with Justin Kang
  from Yesware\, Inc. and Janice Caillet from iSTARTUP\nas together we hold 
 the second monthly Feast in the Boston area.\n\nOur Theme This Month:  Empa
 thy\n\nThe world’s a tough place\, but we’re all in it together. This month
  we’re exploring the power — and challenge — of empathy\, by asking how we 
 can embrace this emotion in our work to change the world. \n\nWe’ve made a 
 lot of progress getting along with each other\, but there’s still lots to d
 o. Even as technology connects us\, we’re retreating more and more into our
  own silos of opinion and beliefs. And as we all know\, a house divided doe
 s not stand. \n\nSo\, how do we enable empathy between completely different
  groups? How might we learn to engage each other again\, and to move beyond
  difference?\n\nFrom street art that reminds us we’re all human\, to data v
 isualizations that bring out the lives behind the numbers\, to school progr
 ams addressing inequality\, how might we use empathy to cross the divide an
 d better connect humanity?\n\nJoin us for a feast like none other in Boston
  as the conversation also unfolds in New York\, Mexico City\, Kuala Lumpur 
 and Toronto. \n\nOur guest speaker will be Yousef Bashir\, a Palestinian na
 tive and 2013 graduate of Northeastern University with a BA in Internationa
 l Affairs. Based on his experience of growing up in Gaza\, Yousef has spoke
 n widely on behalf of mutual understanding and acceptance in the Middle Eas
 t\, with the goal of creating a world movement for peace and forgiveness: "
 To err is human\, to forgive is divine." He is currently studying negotiati
 on. coexistence\, and conflict for his MA at Brandeis Heller School for Soc
 ial Policy and Management.\n\nTogether\, we will break bread (and other goo
 dies). Your ticket price will cover the provided meal\, while you'll be exp
 ected to bring an open mind to contribute to the discussion and share with 
 the group a commitment (big or small) to follow through after the dinner. Y
 ou may also bring your own beverages (beer\, wine\, soda\, otherwise)\, if 
 you'd like something other than water\, tea\, or coffee.  \n\nWe'll start g
 athering at 6:30\, and our guest speaker will kick off our dialogue startin
 g at 7:00 pm.\n\nWE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOU AT OUR TABLE.\n\n\nGeoff\, S
 haina\, Katie\, Justin & Janice\n\n\nCheck out what the Huffington Post wro
